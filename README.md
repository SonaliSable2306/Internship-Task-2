# Titanic Dataset - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

This task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights that may help in predictive modeling.

## Steps Performed

- Load and preview the dataset  
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.)  
- Check for missing values and data types  
- Univariate analysis of features like Age, Fare, Sex, Pclass, etc.  
- Bivariate analysis with target feature 'Survived'  
- Visualize relationships using bar plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps  
- Multivariate analysis using correlation matrix  
- Detect and interpret patterns (e.g., survival rates by gender and class)  
- Identify and visualize outliers
